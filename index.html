          ជម្រាបសួរ! This website is dedicated to promoting the unique flavors
          of both popular and forgotten Cambodian street foods. As a young
          Cambodian teen, I've always been intrigued by the diversity and beauty
          of the Khmer culture, especially the origin and authenticity of their
          local cuisine. Since I grew up in a busy neighborhood where food carts
          and stands could be found everywhere across the streets, I was
          introduced to many traditional street foods as my family would enjoy
          them during the weekend. Unfortunately, due to the pandemic, we
          haven't been able to enjoy them as often as we used to. Instead, I’ve
          been a lot more into cooking as a stress-relieving hobby. Therefore, I
          was inspired to learn how to make those dishes and document them into
          this website.
        </p>
        <p>
          When it comes to mind, any types of dish found on the streets are
          considered as street foods. Therefore, organizing these dishes into
          separate pages regarding what type of dish they are would make more
          sense and make it more convenient for the readers. You can either use
          click on the word Recipe on the menu bar or the yellow indication box
          to the recipes you want.

          Cambodia is a Southeast Asian country that is located in the southern
          part of the Indochinese peninsula. It spans 181,035 square kilometers
          (69,898 square miles) and is bordered on the northwest by Thailand,
          the north by Laos, the east by Vietnam, and the southwest by the Gulf
          of Thailand. Phnom Penh is the capital and largest city of Cambodia.
        </p>

        <p>
          Cambodian cuisine has adopted parts of Indian, Chinese, and, more
          recently, French cuisine over time, and it shares many similarities
          with Thai, Vietnamese, and Lao cuisines as a result of some of these
          shared influences and mutual contact. Without using any fats or meats,
          the Khmer civilization has mastered the use of herbs and spices to
          generate flavor. Prahok, a fermented paste formed from a small fish
          called trey riel, is a staple of Khmer cuisine (Henicorhynchus
          siamensis). Prahok is used as a condiment as well as a key ingredient
          in a variety of Khmer recipes, and it makes up a significant amount of
          the Khmer diet's protein. Even farmers from outlying regions will go
          considerable distances to swap rice for it because it is so desirable.
        </p>

        <p>
          During the Khmer Rouge's purges from 1975 to 1979, Khmer culture was
          severely harmed. Nearly two million Cambodians were slain, tortured,
          or forced to work to death in labor camps, leaving little room for
          economic development. During those dreadful years, prahok, like most
          other foods, was scarce, and many people went hungry. The Khmer Rouge
          dictatorship had an impact on the Khmer people's overall culture. A
          great deal of information was lost, and regulations that prevented the
          transmission of traditions had an impact on Khmer food. The social and
          economic consequences of the time spanned decades.
        </p>

        <p>
          Bananas are very abundant in certain regions of Cambodia. Due to the
          abundance of this fruit, they were heavily utilized by the locals in
          making after-meal desserts and other snacks. Its leaves are also used
          as wrappers and props for those dishes in restaurants and local food
          places. Their flowers are used in salads and soups and steamed or raw
          with the noodle dish known as Nom Banh Chok. They also utilize the
          stem of the banana plant to make jewelry for special occasions, as
          well as grinding it up and mixing it with rice as animal feed.
