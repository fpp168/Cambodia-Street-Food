          Hey there! Thank you for dedicating your time to reading and skimming
          through this website. I am Jen and I am currently a sophomore student
          at Northbridge International School of Cambodia (NISC). I am so proud
          that this website turned out very well after all the effort and mental
          energy I've dedicated to creating this online cookbook. Throughout the
          production process, I'm very grateful for all the support and advice I
          received from those who've helped me during my hard times including my
          family, friends, and supervisor. This book consists of 10 authentic
          Khmer local recipes that I and my family used to enjoy back in the
          days when COVID wasn't a thing. I hope that this website will help you
          develop your cooking skills as well as learn more about the Khmer
          local cuisine and the beauty of our culture. Thank you!
        </p>

          <li>Why did you choose these dishes?</li>
          <blockquote>
            My goal was to write recipes for ONLY authentic local dishes that
            were made and preserved for the younger generations of the Khmer
            people. According to my research regarding our local foods, there
            are a variety of dishes that weren't actually made by our ancestors.
            They are either from neighboring countries or influenced by our
            colonizers back in the old days. As I've talked to the elders, these
            dishes were actually made by our ancestors with some influences from
            other nations. Thatâ€™s why I chose these dishes for my website.
          </blockquote>
          <li>Which dish did you like the best (or the least) why?</li>
          <blockquote>
            I think that my favorite dish has to be Songkya or the
            Cambodian-styled pumpkin custard. Since pumpkin is one of my
            favorite fruits, I really like the sweet and creamy taste of this
            dish and I like how it's very easy and simple to recreate the dish
            as it requires little ingredients that could be found anywhere.
          </blockquote>
          <li>How long did it take me to make this website?</li>
          <blockquote>
            It took me like 6 to 7 months just to get everything done. However,
            it shouldn't take that long if you're highly motivated and committed
            to finishing everything in a short period.
          </blockquote>
          <li>
            What are the challenges you faced while programming the website?
          </li>
          <blockquote>
            Other than the lack of motivation and frequent procrastination, I
            find that figuring out and estimating the size of the font and the
            space or gap of each text, image, shape, etc. would be the most
            challenging part of the website construction process. It has brought
            me so many headaches and mental breakdowns. Another constraint I
            remember was having to fix errors and misplacements of the codes. I
            had to ask my brother for help.
          </blockquote>
          <li>
            What did you use to take images of your dishes? What platform did
            you use to edit them?
          </li>
          <blockquote>
            I personally used my iPhone 11 pro to capture all the images of the
            dishes I made. I also utilized the gallery edit function of the
            iPhone to adjust the lighting and brightness of the pictures to make
            them look more appealing and professional. As for editing/adding
            scribbles to those pictures, I did it on Canva.
          </blockquote>
          <li>
            Did you make this entire website alone? Who taught you how to make
            these dishes?
          </li>
          <blockquote>
            To be very honest, no, I didn't make this entire website alone. I
            had a lot of guidance and help from my brother as it was very hard
            for me to manage and work on everything on my own. As for cooking, I
            had my nanny and my grandma to guide me on making those recipes and
            I got a little help from youtube as well.
